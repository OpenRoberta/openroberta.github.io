In addition to our recent changes in the configuration tab of the systems, we have added a visualization of the configuration. The configuration blocks themselves haven't changed but the board and the connections are now visible. The "wires" should give the users an idea of where the connections are located on the real microcontroller board. Changes can still only be made in the pins dropdown fields, but they are visualized immediately. The following picture shows an example of a configuration of an Arduino Uno.

And here is the corresponding documentation of the project.

The visualization feature is available for the following systems:
* Arduino
* Calliope mini
* Micro:Bit
